              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.

                  DeletionPolicy specifies what will happen to the underlying external

                  external resource.
                  This field is planned to be deprecated in favor of the ManagementPolicies
                  field in a future release. Currently, both could be set independently and
                  non-default values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled.

                  in InitProvider are merged into ForProvider when the resource is created.
                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
